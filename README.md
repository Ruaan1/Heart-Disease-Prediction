# Heart Disease Prediction Using Probabilistic Graphical Models

This project implements a **Bayesian Network** to model and predict the presence of heart disease based on patient attributes and clinical measurements.  
The emphasis is on **probabilistic reasoning**, conditional independence assumptions, and interpretability rather than purely predictive performance.

The dataset is derived from the **Cleveland Heart Disease dataset**, a commonly used benchmark in medical ML research.

## 🧠 Motivation

Medical diagnosis inherently involves uncertainty. Rather than treating heart disease prediction as a black-box classification problem, this project explores a **probabilistic approach** that explicitly models relationships between variables and allows reasoning under uncertainty.

Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) provide:
- interpretable structure
- principled handling of uncertainty
- transparent assumptions about conditional dependence
